  <h2 style="background-color: coral; color: powderblue;">JavaScript</h2>
  <p><span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS, is a programming
    language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
    alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. Over 97% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the 
    client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
    All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute 
    the code on the user's device.

    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that 
    conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
    supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, 
    dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
