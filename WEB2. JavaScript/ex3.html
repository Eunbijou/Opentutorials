  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS, is a programming
    language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
    alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the 
    client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute 
    the code on the user's device.

    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that 
    conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
    supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, 
    dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
